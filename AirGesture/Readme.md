Introducing Air Gesture..☺️

Swiping and Scrolling without "touch".

Through this application,

you can perform swipping and scrolling on your Desktop/Laptop with specified hand gestures.

I mean it was just few decades ago; touch screen technology came and now, we even got past that!
Quite unexpectedl! Woww!

I make use of openCV for capturing and displaying frames, pyautoGUI to control mouse and mediapipe to detect palm keypoints in hand.




The Demo for using the software is given in the file - demo.mp4.

Keep sure to checkout the requirements in requirements.txt !
